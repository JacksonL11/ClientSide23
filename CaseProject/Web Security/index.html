         Web security is a critical issue, and visitors should be educated about it.
        </h1>
        <p>
          There are several ways to improve web security, such as:
<br>
Using HTTPS: HTTPS encrypts data that is transferred between a web server and a user's browser, which makes it more difficult for hackers to intercept the data.
<br>
Keeping software updated: Software updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
<br>
Using strong passwords: Weak passwords are easy to guess, so it's important to use strong passwords that are difficult to crack.
<br>
Avoiding suspicious websites: Some websites can contain malware or other types of malicious code that can infect a user's computer or steal their data.
